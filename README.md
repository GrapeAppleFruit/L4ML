Left 4 Machine Learning, a machine learning to play Left 4 Dead 2.

# Training Data
I will release all training data I get within all official maps onto my website at rastastick.com for free download, along with my current model
When getting your own data the model will get the data from training_data folder and then the subfolders gameplay is for in-game images, loading is for loading images, menu is for menu images (pause menu included), uncertain are images that have a below 95% confidence rate which you can change in the code (I've set it to that because my model is sufficient enough to have above a 98% confidence rate), you'll have to manually go through uncertain data and sort it yourself.
